Kene is a graduate of the Erasmus+ Master's in Marine Environment and Resources. Working on the reconstruction of satellite imagery using computational algorithms for his master thesis relaunched a salient interest in machine learning, deep learning and neural networks. The interest in neuroscience and how the mind and brain interact comes from personal experiences.
