### November 2021

I resumed studying after the 8th of November with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. At the same time, I was trying to put in some webscraping skills from Al Sweigart's book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python but I didn't have much success. Some things worked and others didn't. The whole thing looked simple and hard at the same time. I decided I'd have to watch some videos to learn how it could be done well. So I kept it aside for the meantime. 

My understanding of linear algebra was very porous so I had to slow down to catch up with that. Between 8th and 16th of November I was going to work daily where I did very hard manual physical work that not only left me exhausted but also in pain at all my joints and corners. I did not do any coding during this period. I merely read books and tried to sleep at night.

From the 16th, there was a welcome change in some situations and I began to study a bit better. I alternated my work and study days so that there wouldn't be much lag either way. This wasn't the most effective way but it worked a bit. Then I thought I wanted a blog or website to document my progress and keep me accountable. I thought I'd try to build one on wowChemy, Netlify and GitHub using RBlogdown. Several trials before I had to stop myself from perfectionism and just get the silly thing done. I kept the Rblogdown to one side and just focused on editing using the CMS and git repo. When I'm a bit freer I'll come back and see just how Rblogdown works.

### December 2021

First week was mixed with last week of November. I presented a poster of my Master thesis work. I studied more, cut off unnecessary communications. Weekend of first week and all of second week was manual work except when my joints were all hurting. Since there was no work for me from the week of 15th I had to earn as much as possible before taking a break. During this time, I was also working on the website. Trying to figure out how to set up a custom domain name, get a better theme template. Deleting and editing like mad. Around 9th of December, I published the first post.

I failed a simple quiz on the Machine Learning tutorial several times so I said, "Enough!" I looked up [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com) of Grant Sanderson and started running through the Linear Algebra basics. It was going well at the beginning but the later classes started to seem like I wasn't using it in any practical way. One of those days to chill off, I decided to revisit the webscraping thing again especially for two purposes: to get specific jobs from MetJobs and to get specific kinds of profiles on a dating site. The week that began on 13th I stumbled on Corey Schafer's webscraping tutorial. Then John Watson Rooney. Then Keith Galli. I used the tutorials from Corey and John to tryout some scraping of my own. Keith's was really detailed and I learnt a lot from him but as I was not yet able to put them into use directly I noted some of the new interesting things on paper.

After Corey's tutorials, I used them to scrape his site for all his tutorials, applying something I learnt from John about turning pages. I tried to scrape the dating site but something was wrong with my code and I was getting captcha in my source even though I was logged in. Also their page used a lot of javascript. So I went out again and saw CodingEntrepreneurs who used selenium to deal with pages whose submit buttons did not have a destination page coded in but were handled by javascript. He used it on Instagram. It was really good work and I noted that I'll revisit that tutorial. It would definitely work for this dating site. It made me realise that the dating site is run really like a business. I knew this already but now it was confirmed.

That was the last week I worked. After the 18th, everything stood still for about a week. Just did random things like deciding to change my OS again. Reviewed some Linux distros and downloaded a few to try out before reinstalling. Kubuntu, Kali and Tails made my list. Installed Kubuntu as the main one. From 28th December I kind of got back the balance because the storm was over.

I started watching all of Corey's Python tutorials on the basics like modules, lists, variables, functions etc.

### JANUARY 2022

By the 5th of January, I'd finished all Corey's Python basics including trying out stuff that came to mind. Then I watched his videos that were not exactly Python like regex, environment variables, cron jobs and so on. In all it was a pretty good brushup on the basics and now I felt I could look at some people's code without feeling overwhelmed. After I was done with this, I thought I'd revisit Bash Scripting because there were a lot of things I felt I'd like to automate on my computer.

It started first with a guide on TLCL.org but it felt weighty and expected me to do a lot without showing examples so I went back and found William Shotts' [Linux Command website](https://www.linuxcommand.org). This was better and incidentally was the one I was using in 2021 at some point during my Master thesis period. From first day, examples plenty. I started again. This time instead of taking notes, I was writing and saving and running the scripts. Sometimes I ran off on my tangents, sometimes I kept to the script to see where it was leading.

**This is 17th of January 2022.** I've covered a lot of ground in one month. I've learnt if, case, while, until, and creating shell functions. Now I'm not scared to see grep or awk. We still dey go. The target is to be ready for Machine Learning jobs by end of February. I wrote a Calculator in Python. A simple one but I solved some bugs I met on the way and I was proud of myself.

#### January 18

I'm going to speed through Andrew's classes. I want to complete the remaining 10 weeks in the next three weeks. So beginning with this week (today is Tuesday) I'm going to take three weeks of courses in one week. With this calculation, I should be finished in the last week of January that is also first week of February. Good luck to me. I'll be averaging four hours each day. During this four hours, research will be strictly on the problem I am trying to solve. No expanded learning. 10 am to 3 pm. From 3 pm I am completely free to go down any rabbit hole I choose until 4 pm when I have to work on the first language study for the day.

#### January 25

I finished two weeks of classes last week compared to the three that I had been targeting. I hope to deal with that this week. Something was wrong with the code of my answers on one of the Octave tutorials. I got the answers but it wouldn't submit. Since the assignment is standalone, I'm going to keep going with the classes and tutorials. Then from time to time check up what could be wrong with the code. That way I can finish the course content in the time specified.
I was planning to look at Object Oriented Programming in February but I couldn't resist. I chucked in one hour and thirty minutes for that yesterday with Corey's tutorials and went as far as the lesson on Inheritance and Subclasses. If I finish this series this January, then I'll have to replace the February plan with something else.

#### January 28

Finished the Python OOP Tutorial series yesterday, all the way to Decorators. I'll still need to look at a separate video Corey made on Decorators. In the meantime for some personal reasons, I am behind on Andrew's programming assignment in Octave. I finished the tutorials for week 4 in one sitting (about 4 hours) but the programming assignments are waiting for me.

### FEBRUARY 2022

#### February 2

Can you believe it! I thought I'd be starting Week 8 this week but I'm only just finishing Week 5. Anyway, the motivation to continue is there and I'm running with it. I'm writing the Neural Network programming assignment for Week 5, and it's going well. I should finish it today and start Week 6.

#### February 4

I finished Week 6 yesterday. One day after I started it. That's good. I still have to do the programming assignment but I think I'll deal with that tomorrow which is Saturday. Today I'll work on Week 7. That way if I successfully complete the lessons for Week 7, I'll be able to do all the programming assignments for Weeks 6 and 7 at the same time. I realised that there is a tutorial for the assignments so I'll use those tomorrow too. Hopefully it should make it go faster.

#### February 10

Due to personal obligations over the weekend of 5-6 February I did not do the programming assignments as I had proposed. Instead I did them on Monday the 7th of February. The first assignment for Week 6 (ex5) took longer than I had anticipated, and I ended up completing both (ex5 and ex6) programming assignments the next day Feb 8th. Same day I started the classes for week 8, took the quizzes and skipped the programming assignment like I did the last time.

I repeated the same for Week 9 which I also did on February 9th (yesterday). Large number of videos. I was zapped after some time. Took a break and finished Week 9 at night, quizzes and all, *tout compris*. Today I attacked Weeks 10 and 11, and I'm officially done. The programming assignments for Weeks 8 and 9 (ex7 and ex8) will be completed today.

As I write this, I'm 98% done with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course. And I'm happy to pat myself on the back and say well done for completing four weeks of classes in three days. And thank you too to Dr. Ng for putting together such a wonderful resource on Coursera.

#### February 15

Yesterday was the Feast of St. Valentine also known as Valentine's Day, the global day to celebrate legitimate lovers (couples and those who are engaged). And I was on the train going from one city to another across two countries. I started working when I got on the train, and was happy to finally conclude and submit the last programming assignment by 10:40 am. I worked on the two programming assignments on the night of 12th and 13th, and morning of 14th. Finally I have 100% completion of Dr. Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome), with a 97.25% score.

I was proud of myself. However knowing that that course is over 10 years old, I have to start work on the next stage to update what I learnt and apply myself to use them in an actual work environment by carrying out some projects.

I was particularly proud of myself because I gave myself targets and pushed them through. Last Friday I also learnt how to use Git for code version control. I read [the book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/), took a tutorial on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/), and read another guide on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/cheatsheets/how-to-use-git-a-reference-guide). So now all the fuzz I had looking at GitHub is gone. I also stumbled on an article by [Lisa Tagliaferri](https://lisatagliaferri.com/) on [maintaining open-source projects](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-maintain-open-source-software-projects) that led me to read about [Licenses](https://choosealicense.com/) for open-source software. I think it's good I ran into it at this time because if I'm writing software, I should know how to deal with the licensing early on. Afterwards I found [more well-written resources on open-source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) in general. As I was typing this I realised I should link to the articles and guides for SEO and also ease of search for anyone who might stumble on this post to read it. So I'm pressing pause to go get the links... Now all the links are on the articles.

#### February 24

I haven't updated or posted since 9 days because I was busy writing code and doing exercises. I had intended to start working on Machine Learning projects directly but the exertion of the two last weeks sort of took its tool. Meanwhile since I had been working mainly on Octave, I wanted to learn a bit about setting up my work environment in Python. I read a number of blogs about the best, or at least reasonable, code editors for Python. I've already used Sublime Text in the past as well as Atom and VS Code. The last two seemed to me a bit clunky. I like Sublime but I wanted something more native to Python, so I stuck with the PyCharm that I've already installed. I also got a book that's like a tutorial on how to get the most out of it. By the way, I'm hoping to start contributing to tutorials in a few months. Places like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com), [Real Python](https://www.realpython.com), [Finxter](https://www.finxter.com) would be a good start.

On the subject of code editors, I have the feeling I'm going to want to try Vims and Emacs. They seem to have such high ratings among developers. For the moment, I type with Kate (comes with Kubuntu). I like the fact that I can divide my writing into sessions and choose the kind of syntax I want but I haven't figured out how to do the thing where you embed a website link in a text. That would make writing blog posts in Kate so much better. **Pause** going to check online to see if I'll find something... One sec and I'll be right back. Back after 5 minutes. Didn't find anything. Will try again later. **I embed the links using the blog CMS.**

What was I up to in the last 9 days? Earlier I was reading Dr. Charles Severance book, [Python for Everyone](https://www.py4e.com), on my tablet. I thought the exercises he gave were really valuable exercises. I had found his book by a chance DuckDuckGo search that landed me on [Jamison Lahman's site](https://jmelahman.github.io/) while I was working on the Coursera ML exercises. So I gave his book a go. From Friday 18th till yesterday, Wednesday 23rd, I worked through the book and the exercises. It was good to write code that did stuff and to start to think about clean coding too. The last exercises I did were the ones in Chapter 11. I'm not doing the 12 and 13 yet because I want to go straight to Machine Learning. However I read through to the end of the book and tried to get a grasp of the remaining topics particularly SQL. I'll revisit those remaining chapters later as I progress with my ML classes. The ML classes I'm referring to is based on the course Zero to Mastery Machine Learning by [Daniel Bourke](https://www.mrdbourke.com) and [Andrei Neagoie](https://www.zerotomastery.io). I really need to get my foot in the door by the end of March so I'm not really keen on stuff that I cannot use now.

I hope to find out which is more useful between PyTorch and TensorFlow as I do this course. I'm also aware that I should be leaning towards [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) at this point. Someone referred to their Machine Learning projects as 'toy' projects. If I haven't played with the toys, what's gonna happen to me and the real thing?

By the way, in the course of editing this post, I switched to markdown, and I think it's hands-down better than *Rich Text Format* because I can add hyperlinks effortlessly. Fancy figuring this out in less than 10 seconds. And to think I always dreaded Markdown!

__Zero to Mastery Starts__

I started the ZTM course in Machine Learning and Data Science on March 3rd. It's going well, and I'm all in.

*__Change in attitude__*:

Sometimes at study I get exhausted which is expected since I start from 8:30am and go on till about 3:00 pm. Then to chill out, I just read up stuff especially long form writing in the areas where I am going to: getting jobs, doing LinkedIn updates, getting inspired and discovering new links and resources in Data Science, Machine Learning, Bash, Business and Innovation.

On Wednesday 2nd, someone was referred to me that had a problem with accessing his files on Windows. I thought I'd be able to fix the boot issues the Windows way  and get his files out but all the tips I saw online did not work for me. Finally I decided to go the Linux way. Run Linux on it and extract the files. I'm going to write this in a blog post so I'm not going to go into details here.

However, while I saw it in the light of helping a friend's friend, he saw it as me providing a service and wanted to pay for it. He wasn't happy that when he arrived at the time I said it would be ready, I hadn't finished transferring all his data to the new computer. And here I was busy feeling like after 24 hours and some staying up to migrate his directories and files out, he was going to be like, "Thank you so much," and all. So something switched in my head before I finished transferring his documents back.

I modified my brain. Henceforth, I'm no longer seeing help as helping, I see it as a service. For me it is help, but from the eyes of the person he is a client and therefore it is a service. To not be _heartbroken_ I should also look at it as he does, like I'm providing a service. This means that the whole nine (or maybe five) yards is in: time, tools, results, communication and charging.

I am applying this same attitude to my training, including the time I spend on tasks, the breaks, the outcomes and networking to get more work. That is to say everything that makes for good work is going in, no holds barred.

_**Scikit-Learn**_

I hit this topic today. When I got to the video that said Scikit-Learn, I felt positively elated. Hitting sciKit-Learn is like arriving at a long-awaited destination, like I'm now at the real machine learning. I'm happy and I'm proud of myself. I hope it goes well, and I'm deadpan sure it will.

In the last four days, I worked on Pandas, numPy and matplotlib. I covered a healthy amount of the basics in the three packages. Knowing Python already is a big help. There's a Python module in the ZTM Machine Learning and Data Science course though I haven't looked at it yet. I know I'll find some interesting things there but since I already have a very good grasp of Python syntax I'll keep going forward. That module is going to be something I'll use to learn new stuff and polish up as I advance.

#### March 15
Still on Scikit-Learn. I gotta give it to Daniel Bourke. He knows how to teach. Following his classes made me think that you don't have to be the last word on a subject to teach another person. You only need to know a little more than the person you are trying to teach.

He has a way of running through new things and showing you how to look for it yourself without being stumped on the details, something I picked when I did the _Learning How to Learn_ course. I already use this technique when I help my friends with their programming assignments in R.

**Need something?**

Look it up. Copy the example. Modify it to your own.

**Why is that this way and not another way?**

Read quickly through the documentation.

**Getting sucked in?**

Stop. Step back.

Time is the measure. Some things will definitely take more time than others to figure out, so let's keep the time free for those kinds of tasks. When dealing with little things, just shoot from the hip. Go straight to the task. That way when you've dealt with the little things and got them out of the way, you'll find that you might have earned yourself some extra time that you can use to explore the more stubborn problems.

When I got fazed out after about four, five hours of ML codes I turned to reading the book ___Cracking the Coding Interview___. Instantly my eyes were alert. There is no time to lose. So we keep going.

#### March 26

Yesterday was March 25, the Feast of the Annunciation (on which is also celebrated Mother's Day).

Yesterday also I completed the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning and Data Science course. 

Three days earlier on the 22nd of March I was almost half way through the course at 182 out of 380. I still had over 9 hours of Python revisions and 8 hours of Deep Learning to go through. Considering that this time was prolonged by trying to follow with the coding at the same time as the tutor while dealing with the problems of runtime reconnection (_Google Colab_) or importing data (_Paperspace Gradient_) I appreciate the effort I put into getting this course done.

On average, for this course I worked for about 8 hours daily beginning from around 7:30 am and stopping at around 4:00 pm. Even with this, on 22nd I thought I'd still be on the course by next week. Now I have gained one full week to work on a project of my own.

What made it possible for me to rev-up the time I gave to the work* was the use of the Pomodoro technique. I used it usually but this time I took it seriously and I think that if I had been more consistent with it I may have completed the course even earlier.

- I realised that with the Pomodoro 5-minute breaks after 25 minutes of work, I was rarely tired even though I worked longer and maybe harder.

- I also kept my phone away in the bedroom while I worked downstairs in the study room. I only got back to the phone at around 5 pm daily. Previously I used to check my phone during my Pomodoro breaks.

- Now for my breaks I either walked, stretched my legs or even sometimes sketched the outline of an article or wrote one.

I don't know if I'll keep working this hard, but I know I'll keep my phone away while I work. That's a habit I definitely want to keep.

This post, **Update**, will reach its full term at the end of this month of March. I have one more week of updates to add on the project(s) I will do.

I subscribe to the idea of doing one whole project that goes end-to-end on Machine Learning incorporating all the areas from data collection, visualising or preprocessing, to actual training, validation and evaluation, testing and making predictions, tuning and deployment, and saving the model to share. It is more cohesive than doing many micro projects that are only potential parts of a whole.

Like always, I'm looking forward to this.


##### Current reading for the weekend:

Effective Python (2nd Edition) by Brett Slatkin

* actually I was studying but you know I already saw it as working
