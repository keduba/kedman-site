*This is a post to keep up with the state of my learning. I'm using it to keep track of how I have been learning and studying with my goal of becoming an expert in machine learning by the end of February.*

### November 2021

I resumed studying after the 8th of November with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. At the same time, I was trying to put in some webscraping skills from Al Sweigart's book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python but I didn't have much success. Some things worked and others didn't. The whole thing looked simple and hard at the same time. I decided I'd have to watch some videos to learn how it could be done well. So I kept it aside for the meantime. 

My understanding of linear algebra was very porous so I had to slow down to catch up with that. Between 8th and 16th of November I was going to work daily where I did very hard manual physical work that not only left me exhausted but also in pain at all my joints and corners. I did not do any coding during this period. I merely read books and tried to sleep at night.

From the 16th, there was a welcome change in some situations and I began to study a bit better. I alternated my work and study days so that there wouldn't be much lag either way. This wasn't the most effective way but it worked a bit. Then I thought I wanted a blog or website to document my progress and keep me accountable. I thought I'd try to build one on wowChemy, Netlify and GitHub using RBlogdown. Several trials before I had to stop myself from perfectionism and just get the silly thing done. I kept the Rblogdown to one side and just focused on editing using the CMS and git repo. When I'm a bit freer I'll come back and see just how Rblogdown works.

### December 2021

First week was mixed with last week of November. I presented a poster of my Master thesis work. I studied more, cut off unnecessary communications. Weekend of first week and all of second week was manual work except when my joints were all hurting. Since there was no work for me from the week of 15th I had to earn as much as possible before taking a break. During this time, I was also working on the website. Trying to figure out how to set up a custom domain name, get a better theme template. Deleting and editing like mad. Around 9th of December, I published the first post.

I failed a simple quiz on the Machine Learning tutorial several times so I said, "Enough!" I looked up 3Blue1Brown of Grant Sanderson and started running through the Linear Algebra basics. It was going well at the beginning but the later classes started to seem like I wasn't using it in any practical way. One of those days to chill off, I decided to revisit the webscraping thing again especially for two purposes: to get specific jobs from MetJobs and to get specific kinds of profiles on a dating site. The week that began on 13th I stumbled on Corey Schafer's webscraping tutorial. Then John Watson Rooney. Then Keith Galli. I used the tutorials from Corey and John to tryout some scraping of my own. Keith's was really detailed and I learnt a lot from him but as I was not yet able to put them into use directly I noted some of the new interesting things on paper.

After Corey's tutorials, I used them to scrape his site for all his tutorials, applying something I learnt from John about turning pages. I tried to scrape the dating site but something was wrong with my code and I was getting captcha in my source even though I was logged in. Also their page used a lot of javascript. So I went out again and saw CodingEntrepreneurs who used selenium to deal with pages whose submit buttons did not have a destination page coded in but were handled by javascript. He used it on Instagram. It was really good work and I noted that I'll revisit that tutorial. It would definitely work for this dating site. It made me realise that the dating site is run really like a business. I knew this already but now it was confirmed.

That was the last week I worked. After the 18th, everything stood still for about a week. Just did random things like deciding to change my OS again. Reviewed some Linux distros and downloaded a few to try out before reinstalling. Kubuntu, Kali and Tails made my list. Installed Kubuntu as the main one. From 28th December I kind of got back the balance because the storm was over.

I started watching all of Corey's Python tutorials on the basics like modules, lists, variables, functions etc.

JANUARY 2022

By the 5th of January, I'd finished all Corey's Python basics including trying out stuff that came to mind. Then I watched his videos that were not exactly Python like regex, environment variables, cron jobs and so on. In all it was a pretty good brushup on the basics and now I felt I could look at some people's code without feeling overwhelmed. After I was done with this, I thought I'd revisit Bash Scripting becuase there were a lot of things I felt I'd like to automate on my computer.

It started first with a guide on tlcl.org but it felt weighty and expected me to do a lot without showing examples so I went back and found William Shotts' linuxcommand.org. This was better and incidentally was the one I was using in 2021 at some point during my Master thesis period. From first day, examples plenty. I started again. This time instead of taking notes, I was writing and saving and running the scripts. Sometimes I ran off on my tangents, sometimes I kept to the script to see where it was leading. This is 17th of January 2022. I've covered ground in one month. I've learnt if, case, while, until, and creating shell functions. Now I'm not scared to see grep or awk. We still dey go. The target is to be ready for Machine Learning jobs by end of February. I wrote a Calculator in Python. A simple one but I solved some bugs I met on the way and I was proud of myself.

#### 18th January:

I'm going to speed through Andrew's classes. I want to complete the remaining 10 weeks in the next three weeks. So beginning with this week (today is Tuesday) I'm going to take three weeks of courses in one week. With this calculation, I should be finished in the last week of January that is also first week of February. Good luck to me. I'll be averaging four hours each day. During this four hours, research will be strictly on the problem I am trying to solve. No expanded learning. 10 am to 3 pm. From 3 pm I am completely free to go down any rabbit hole I choose until 4 pm when I have to work on the first language study for the day.

#### 25th January

I finished two weeks of classes last week compared to the three that I had been targeting. I hope to deal with that this week. Something was wrong with the code of my answers on one of the Octave tutorials. I got the answers but it wouldn't submit. Since the assignment is standalone, I'm going to keep going with the classes and tutorials. Then from time to time check up what could be wrong with the code. That way I can finish the course content in the time specified.
I was planning to look at Object Oriented Programming in February but I couldn't resist. I chucked in one hour and thirty minutes for that yesterday with Corey's tutorials and went as far as the lesson on Inheritance and Subclasses. If I finish this series this January, then I'll have to replace the February plan with something else.
