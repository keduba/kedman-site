summary: Many areas of human activities and endeavours that have acquired a lot
  of data or even information can be influenced by advances in artificial
  intelligence using Machine Learning. By choosing one of such areas, anyone
  with a healthy interest to learn can find a way to contribute as a Machine
  Learning expert.

How did we get here?

I went to the university with the intention to study Electrical Engineering and Electronics. That was what my cousin studied. When she was in her final year of university, I was in the penultimate year in the secondary school. For her degree project, she worked with a friend on designing a programmable traffic light system that figured out how many cars were waiting on the other side and gave them the green or red light. When she explained it to me, about 20 years ago, it sounded like the coolest thing ever. I had that idea in my mind when I was filling out the JAMB form. I could have written JAMB for Medicine or Pharmacy too. I didn't. I chose EE because it was just cool. And I did well in the exams too. I must have scored 243 or 248 out of 400. I didn't get the EE but someone who had 218 got it thanks to a system that rewards mediocrity and average performance based on the region or state of origin you filled out on your application form.

Coming from Anambra, we were supposed to be the brightest and so the standards were high for us while the bar was lowered for those from the North (educationally less-advantaged states was what they called them, meaning that it was okay to do poorly as long as you were from the north). In any case that is story for another day. Faced with the prevalent idea of not staying at home after high school, I took the course I was offered. It wasn't my dream but since I didn't want to pass one year at home, I accepted it. Many other things that influenced my decision (or lack of decision) I am going to gloss over. In any case, the world has run full circle and I am back to the beginning. We are at the Machine Learning stop, and as sure as a hammer on a nail, I'm getting on this bus. Let the silly JAMB system be fixed or not, we are moving on.

And now, we are going to learn about Machine Learning, the different levels to it and see how it can be applied as a technology to an area of interest. I am going to select the area of interest based on several criteria:

1. Where there is need for highly accurate predictions.
2. Where people's lives will be impacted more.
3. An area that can help people live better lives.
4. Where people can be protected.

A number of areas already come to mind. Health care is number one. Food is number two. Protection from natural hazards is also another area. Insurance of lives and property is still a potential one. The choice of which area to apply myself will depend on my own personal interests and leaning. The education you already have will be an advantage in that it can shape how you look and what you spot because it will give you some sort of fresh eyes, but it need not restrict you. The essence of this is to be able to escape from the academic backgrounds that we did not love but we nonetheless invested ourselves in to learn from. In other words, take what you learnt from your previous background and education and go forward to where you are now interested.

The reason for making this decision at this point is that Machine Learning and the entire gamut of Artificial intelligence is only useful when applied to a given field. So except you're a mathematician or statistician who is bent on discovering the best algorithm for calculating the least cost function or something like that, machine learning algorithms for their own sake should not be your goal. Rather let us approach it from the point of view of people who already have problems to solve, situations to predict and maybe prevent, and hurdles to overcome.

Each of the areas that we listed in the penultimate paragraph have at least a number of subareas under them. For example, those in the health care can be applied to anything from oncology, optometry, neuroscience, neurobiology, even maternal care (think [Ubenwa](www.ubenwa.ai)), cardiology and more. For food, we can think about the fisheries, agriculture, and aquaculture among others. There is also transportation: aerial, maritime, and land. The thing is that most of these applications of ML are also going to be cross-disciplinary. Maritime transportation for example is also going to say hello to oceanography for instance. Just as, in health, neuroscience and machine learning are no longer strange bedfellows. The implication is that although one might not be an expert in the 'other' field, a healthy interest and willingness to learn the bolts and nuts of the other field may not only be necessary, it may be required. Otherwise how can you contribute to the field? Your algorithm would remain just that, a set of mathematical equations.

So allons-y! Let's take some time and look around for fields of study where we are interested and will be happy to contribute to make things better. Consider that those who are experts in these fields are already busy trying to solve the problems that have accumulated and may not have the time to go learn how ML/DL/NN works and how it can help them solve their problems. It's up to you to observe from the sidelines and show them how you can make their lives better, release time for them to go home early, have more fireside dinners and take longer walks in the park.

When you've found one area, come back here. There'll be another post waiting for you.
