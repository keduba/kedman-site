It has been a while since I last wrote anything literary. One of the reasons was that I started to feel that there was no need to do any such thing, that I had nothing literary to offer, that since I was no longer reading as much as before, in fact since I was no longer reading other people I had no right to write what other people would read. This is very true. I felt like this for a long time. I also felt that everything has been done, so why do more?

However something inside me wants to get out. Like when you're feeling down and you just want to pour out your gibberish so that you feel lighter and can float again. I am not an interesting subject and so I shall not bother to talk about what I felt or what may have happened to me. That means I am only going to write because it feels like  talking. Small talk. Chitchat. Blabber. Gibberish. Just to feel light.

It's interesting to realise that most of the time our actions are guided by our imaginations even when we are not aware. It is quite uncanny. The good things we do, and the bad, are preceded by one flash or two of imagination. It's a picture, a mental one, that often we try to realise. What would it be like if I said good morning to everyone I passed on the street? What would it be like if I smiled at everyone I met? How would it feel to walk around the city without wearing my mask or even having it on me at all? What would it feel like to tell her that I swoon for her?

The can be challenging images and sometimes we even try to realise them. When we accept the image, it becomes something we want to do, to see. When we reject it, it is unrealised. Sometimes it comes back to haunt us, other times it just dies never to be heard of again.

I am not a psychologist but it seems that being able to direct or control our imagination is a way to control our lives both by ourselves and even through other people. That is where the trained psychologist has her work cut out for her. She is playing the role of the stranger we can confide in, and the 'friend' who knows what is good for us and helps us to 'see' it. When we see it then we start to realise this new state that we desire. Our imagination has a picture that our will can work towards. It's so uncanny the way this thing works.

Many people are trapped in an old life because their imagination is fixed on an old thing. I certainly was for a long time. And it's something I see everyday when I pass someone who has no home and sleeps on the streets in front of houses, or in the train station. I see it when someone passes me on the street and the eyes wear that soulful pity-me kind of look that one encounters with those who are married to the bottle. There was a time when I had those kind of eyes, and I was never even engaged to the bottle.

So it is probably one of the features of the Help-Me-Change-My-Imagination Association. When one is enslaved to a particular kind of mental image and they just want to change it, they need help. The image could be beer and drink, smoke and weed, pleasure of the body, or in extreme cases pleasure of pain. Whatever it is, when this image predominates the mind, the mind is enslaved and the eyes say the true story. It cries for help,"Set me free!" 

Perhaps that's why the members of the fellowship of the bottle are the most loquacious because it loosens their tongue to tell their story. Sadly every affair with the bottle makes their stories incoherent and after listening you just don't know what to do or where to start to help. Then there are other people who need help with changing the pictures that play on repeat in their heads. I already mentioned some examples. The thing is that as it's always in the eyes, we need to look people in the eyes to see this and when we don't look people in the eyes we can't see it. We can't really meet them (except they are autistic and just won't make eye contact). This might be you too. I know it was definitely me for many years. And o! Be aware of those who always want to make eye contact. Like they say, too much of everything is not good. The ones who always want to catch your eye and the ones who always feel the need to look away, both groups need attention. If you know someone in any of these groups or categories it is a good idea to help them find help.

It is such a strange and yet interesting idea to think that all we need to do in order modify our lives is to change the picture that is in our head, to replace with a better picture the one that is currently there and we become better. It is not like a light switch that comes on automatically. No, but it is far more captivating, far more breathtaking. It is like a tsunami. From afar you sense it. You don't see it at once but you feel that something will happen eventually. And it does. And the effect is like breeze in a green field full of poppies that leaves you at once full of wonder.

This experience must have been one of those that led Saint Paul to say in one of his letters (to the Philippians),"...whatever is of good fame ... think on these things." And if you try to think or to imagine and you find your imagination flooded with baggage that you don't want, be nothing daunted. Keep feeding it what you want and one day you will find the balance even out. Then another day you will find the balance tilted in favour of the new image. Then you will see that it was well worth the effort. Again, I'm no psych(-ologist or -iatrist) but that's at the root of what they help people do.
