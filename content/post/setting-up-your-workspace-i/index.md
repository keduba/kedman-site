Anyone doing software development, data science, programming or any computational task knows the importance of having fast respond times.

Codes are optimised to run faster. Parallel computing is done on various CPU or GPU threads. Sometimes we don't mind paying for faster processors. All these are so that we have an optimum work experience.

Sometimes while doing the _external_ efforts we forget to look out for the internal efforts, the task of organising our layout of the computer or PC itself. Due to the frantic nature of work from time to time, the tendency does arise to leave old files or temporary files around the place. 

We all know someone whose desktop is so filled with files that it's impossible to see the wallpaper. One of the effects of this is that it be distracting when you don't have motivation to work. On the other hand, what can keep you inspired is the organisation of your workspace so that it is free from clutter.

This begins from your directory or folder structure. Both directory and folder are refering to the same idea of grouping similar items in one place. Having a consistent folder structure is key to working efficiently. You should be able to find your files or folders easily without thinking about it. Efficient file system structure includes some of the following elements:

* Having a separate folder each for work and personal documents.
* Arranging directories according to functions. For example: Work, Personal, Blog posts, Textbooks, Articles and Invoices.
* An extension of this can be dividing the Downloads directory into PDF, Images, Zips, Tars, Temps subdirectories. This will enable you find those kinds of files quickly without having to scroll through a lot of unrelated folders.
* Having a naming system also helps. For example, if you download Machine Learning materials from the internet, prefacing them with ML will help you sort them easily. So ML for Machine Learning, DS for Data Science, PY for Python, R for R (of course) etc. 

  Using underscores after this prefix will further simplify things for you. A concrete example would be to name a file like so: _PY_LearnPython.pdf_. If you were to automate the moving of your files to relevant folders, it would be cheesecake to move this to a folder for only Python books.

* Another way to name personal files can be to append the year, month and day (YYMMDD) before the title of the document. This can help with an informal version control. The first draft of this post is called _220519_workspace_v1.md_. 


  This will help me remember when I wrote it first. By the time the draft is done and I revise it, I'll save that as _220519_workspace_v2.md_ so I can flip between both versions without worrying about losing a cute sounding sentence.


* One last thing can be to think of a reasonable folder structure that you use for your day-to-day tasks then make a template of this folder and store it in a Template directory. 


  That way if you need to create a new set of folders for a particular subject or task that is similar to your current tasks but different, you can replicate the same structure and have the same predictable access. 

  An example of this can be if you are in the habit of downloading study materials which include both books and published articles on different subjects, then it would be useful to have a separate folder for each. 


```markdown
├── Materials
│   ├── SUBJECT
│   │   ├── Textbooks
│   │   ├── Articles
```


With a simple outline as above, all the books you have on a given subject go into the Books subdirectory, and the articles go into the Articles subdirectory. You can create this as a template and then copy the template to the Materials or Resources or whatever directory. A similar approach can be applied to other subjects according to your personal and professional workflow.

The goal is to save time on mundane tasks so that you can concentrate on being better at what you do.

The next post will relate to having work templates for different software or programming environments and tasks particularly related to Data Science. See you then.
